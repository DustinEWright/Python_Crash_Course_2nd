"""
A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on
a personâ€™s age.
If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free;
if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10
if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15

Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost
of their movie ticket.
